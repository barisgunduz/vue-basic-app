## What i learned
Some Vue basics.

- Localization (Did with i18n. Easy entegration.)
- Autocomplete (I've done similar projects but not in Vue.)

## TO-DO
- Fake-backend to a real api. (Self improvement)
- Refactoring. (Need to refactor components. Can be a little more clean)
- Contact Page -> Search for country -> Send -> console.log() not sending. Some error occuring when "v-model" added.
- More practise.
